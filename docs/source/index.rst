Welcome to django-altcha's documentation!
=========================================

Django Altcha is a Django library that provides easy integration of Altcha CAPTCHA
into your Django forms, enhancing user verification with configurable options.

By default, CAPTCHA validation operates in a **fully self-hosted mode**,
**eliminating the need for external services** while ensuring privacy and control over
the verification process.
